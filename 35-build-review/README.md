# Build & Review

## Questions?!?
- negative aspect to building fail safe 
- pageNums at the bottom 

## Things to discuss:
- The last video is taking AGES to process. Sorry for ze delay >.<
- Poll results
    - Awesome overall! I will send notes on them later today
    - Number one basically everyone got the object setState and a few got functional setState
    - Number two basically everyone got both! onClick={this.handleClick}  *and* onClick={ event => this.handleClick(event) }
    - Number three was state in MainContainer which basically all of you got!
    - Number four was split between MainContainer and App. App was the correct answer. Let's talk about why!
- Updates to package.json start script
- Fetching and keeping data on state 


## Features to Build / Update
- (kind of fake) The Fetch
- Adding page numbers 
- Drying out increaseIndex & decreaseIndex
- Liking a restaurant & conditionally rendering just the symbol underneath
